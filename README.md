# 3D Bin Packing
Made By: [Parv Patel](https://github.com/ParvPatel01).

An interactive 3D bin packing web application built with React and Three.js. This tool demonstrates an efficient packing algorithm by arranging boxes inside a pallet in 3D space. Users can modify pallet size and box quantities, then visualize the optimal packing solution dynamically.

## Features

- Custom 3D bin packing algorithm with layer-based packing and skyline heuristic
- Supports multiple pallet orientations and selects best packing utilization
- Dynamic UI for pallet dimensions and box quantities
- Real-time 3D visualization with Three.js and TrackballControls
- Responsive React interface with adjustable camera controls
- Modular TypeScript codebase for easy customization and extension
